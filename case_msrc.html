        <h2>[Cross-Platform] AI-Assisted gcloud CLI Session Hijacking</h2>

        <div class="meta">
            <p><strong>Credited As:</strong> Develop Aguascalientes</p>
            <p><strong>Vulnerability Type:</strong> Security UI Spoofing / Session Hijacking</p>
            <p><strong>Programs:</strong> Google Cloud VRP, Microsoft MSRC</p>
        </div>

        <h3>High-Confidence Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
            This report details a novel, sophisticated, cross-platform attack vector that allows for the hijacking of Google Cloud (gcloud) CLI sessions. The method leverages third-party AI chatbot interfaces (e.g., Microsoft Copilot) to act as a **"blind proxy"** for malicious authentication, bypassing the AI's security filters and the user's consent.
        </p>

        <h3>Hypothesized Attack Chain</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initial Compromise:</strong> The user's environment is compromised, likely via a trojanized application authorized through a deceptive OAuth screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Credential Exfiltration:</strong> The malware exfiltrates a time-sensitive, single-use authentication secret (e.g., a <code>DCB_ASSOCIATION</code> string) from the victim's account.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Blind Proxy" Exploit:</strong> The attacker pastes this secret string into a third-party AI chatbot interface. The frontend of the AI platform renders a functional gcloud login QR code on the attacker's screen.</li>
            <li><strong>The "AI Blind Spot":</strong> The AI's security filters are bypassed, as the AI backend is unaware of the visual QR code being rendered; it only processes the text string, which does not appear malicious on its own.</li>
            <li><strong>Session Hijacking:</strong> The attacker scans the QR code, successfully authenticating a new, malicious gcloud CLI session on their own machine with the victim's credentials, gaining full control of their GCP resources.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>The "AI Blind Spot" Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
            The core of this vulnerability is that the gcloud authentication flow is susceptible to having its QR codes generated on a trusted, third-party platform where the underlying security AI is blind to the final visual output. When asked what it is showing, the AI confirms it is only aware of the text string, not the QR code its own interface has displayed. This allows an attacker to bypass user consent and security checks that would occur during a normal, direct login flow.
        </p>

        <h3>Evidence & Proof-of-Concept Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            The primary evidence for this hypothesis comes from a saved chat log where the malicious <code>DCB_ASSOCIATION</code> string, exfiltrated from a compromised Google Account, was rendered as a functional login QR code.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PoC Non-Reproducibility:</strong> It is critical to note that this specific PoC is no longer reproducible. The token string was time-sensitive and has expired, which is the expected behavior for a single-use authentication credential.</li>
            <li><strong>Expired Token as Evidence:</strong> This "before and after" state serves as strong evidence that the string was a live, functional token used in the attack. The fact that it expired confirms its nature as a legitimate, temporary credential.</li>
        </ul>
