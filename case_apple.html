        <h2>[iPadOS] Captive Portal Session Bleed & Cross-Service Hijacking</h2>

        <div class="meta">
            <p><strong>Credited As:</strong> Erik Sabina (Develop Aguascalientes)</p>
            <p><strong>Vulnerability Type:</strong> Sandbox Escape / Session Hijacking</p>
            <p><strong>Program:</strong> Apple Security Bounty</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            A critical vulnerability was discovered in the iPadOS captive portal (Wi-Fi network login screen) that allows a sandboxed authentication session to "bleed" out and grant unrestricted access to the underlying browser. This flaw allows an attacker with physical access to a device at the "Activation Lock" screen to bypass all restrictions and gain a persistent, authenticated session. This session can then be used to hijack the owner's identity across a multitude of high-value, unrelated third-party services, effectively taking over their digital life.
        </p>

        <h3>Technical Details: The "Session Bleed" Anomaly</h3>
        <p>
            The captive portal is intended to be an isolated, temporary environment for network authentication only. However, after authenticating to the network, it was found that the session's context was not properly contained. By manually navigating to a website like Google.com, the portal window transforms into a fully functional, albeit chromeless, browser. The authenticated Google session from this window is then shared with other services that use Google for OAuth, leading to a full cross-service hijack.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Confirmed Exploitation Vectors</h3>
        <p>
            Once the initial bypass was achieved, the persistent session was successfully used to authenticate and take control of the following services:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple Ecosystem:</strong> Full access to Apple ID management and iCloud services.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Ecosystem:</strong> Complete access to Google Account, Gmail, and Google Drive.</li>
            <li><strong>Development Platforms:</strong> Authenticated into GitHub and Replit, gaining access to source code and remote shell environments.</li>
            <li><strong>AI & Data Services:</strong> Authorized ChatGPT to access and exfiltrate files from the user's Google Drive.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="coup-de-grace">
            <h3>The "Coup de Grâce": Remote Desktop & Network Bridge</h3>
            <p>
                The most critical escalation of this vulnerability was achieved by using the hijacked session to install and operate **Chrome Remote Desktop**. This allowed the locked iPad to take full control of an external machine, rendering all on-device policies irrelevant and effectively turning the iPad into a secure bridge to launch advanced tools against the local network it was connected to.
